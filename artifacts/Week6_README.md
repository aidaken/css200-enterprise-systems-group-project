# Week 6 Summary
In Week 6, our team moved from a high-level vision to a clearer definition of what the system must actually do. 
We created a System Requirements Document for our Outlook inbox triage plugin, focusing on how the plugin supports students who feel overwhelmed by unfiltered emails. 
The requirements explain what students need (like quickly seeing urgent messages and having emails grouped into meaningful categories such as Academics, Finance, Registration, Careers & Internships, Campus Events, and News) and what the system must do to support those needs (like rule-based filtering, a high-priority view, and user customization). 
We also added introductory non-functional requirements to show the expected quality of the system, including performance (loading within 3 seconds), availability (99.5% uptime), and privacy/security principles (least-privilege access, FERPA-aligned handling, and no storing of email body content). Overall, Week 6 helped us lock the scope and expectations before we move into architecture and platform decisions in Week 7.
