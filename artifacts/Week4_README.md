# Summary of Week 4 Assignment

In Week 4, our team defined the system vision for an Outlook plugin designed to reduce student inbox overload. The main problem is that students receive a high volume of mixed university emails in one inbox, which makes it hard to recognize what is urgent and what requires action. Our proposed solution is a plugin that organizes emails into student-relevant categories such as Academics, Finance, Registration, Careers & Internships, Campus Events, and News. The plugin also helps students quickly identify urgent messages, especially those tied to near-term deadlines. To keep the project realistic and privacy-conscious, our early version focuses on using email metadata (sender domain, subject line, timestamps, and Outlook tags/flags) rather than reading or storing email body content. The vision sets a clear direction for later work, including system requirements, system architecture, and eventual platform mapping in future weeks.
