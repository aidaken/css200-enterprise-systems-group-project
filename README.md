# Enterprise Systems Portfolio (Course Repository)

Welcome to my course portfolio repository. This GitHub repo is a place where I collect and explain the work I’m doing in Phase 2 of this course, especially the parts that show how I think about systems, users, and enterprise-style requirements. Even when parts of the project are created as a team, this portfolio is meant to reflect my individual understanding and communication skills, the way an employer or internship reviewer would expect.

In our project, we are addressing a very common student problem: inbox overload. Students receive a high volume of messages through Outlook from many different areas of the university. Some messages are truly time-sensitive, like academic deadlines, financial notices, or registration issues. Other messages are useful but not urgent, like campus events and general updates. Because everything arrives in a single stream and often looks equally important, students have to spend extra time scanning and searching just to figure out what matters. This creates cognitive overload and increases the chance that students will miss important actions.

Our system vision is to make Outlook more helpful for students without replacing it. The concept is an Outlook plugin that organizes emails into student-relevant categories such as Academics, Finance, Registration, Careers & Internships, Campus Events, and News. The plugin should make it easier to notice urgent items, for example by highlighting messages connected to deadlines within the next two days or items that clearly require action. A major design choice in our early version is privacy: the plugin focuses on using email metadata like subject lines, sender domains, timestamps, and existing Outlook tags or flags. At this stage, we are not reading or storing message body content, because privacy and FERPA-aligned handling matter for student communications and we want a realistic scope for this phase.

My role on the team is Product Manager. In that role, I help keep the team aligned on the problem we are solving and the scope of our solution. I also help translate our vision into clear documentation, especially requirements that describe what the system must do and what students need from it. I’m responsible for making sure our deliverables are organized, readable, and grounded in real student needs, rather than becoming a random list of features.
This repository is organized so the instructor (and future reviewers) can quickly find key course artifacts. I am using an “artifacts” section to store important documents from each week. Over time this repo will grow as we add system diagrams, requirements, and reflections.

As I continue this course, I’ll update this repository with new artifacts and short reflections on how our thinking evolves. The goal is not just to complete assignments, but to demonstrate that I can explain a system clearly, make good scope decisions, and communicate my role and reasoning in a way that is useful for real stakeholders.
